\chapter{QUESO Examples}\label{chap:Queso-examples}

This chapter assumes that the user has successfully installed QUESO and its dependencies.
%
It presents a variety of  examples of how to use QUESO in order to develop applications that solves a statistical inverse problem (Section \ref{sec:example_sip}), a statistical forward problem (Section \ref{sec:example_sfp}) or a combination of both, where the solution of the former serves as input to the later (Sections \ref{sec:example_gravity} and \ref{sec:example_tga}). 
Each section presents: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item the mathematical models for the SIP and/or the SFP; \vspace*{-6pt}
 \item the application codes  that translate the mathematical language into C++ using the QUESO classes and algorithms;\vspace*{-6pt}
 \item  the input file that contains a list of options for the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (in case of SIPs) and the Monte Carlo algorithm (in case of SFPs) which will be used by QUESO classes and algorithms\footnote{At this moment, all the SIP examples are solved with MCMC (DRAM) algorithm; in a future version, examples using the Multilevel algorithm will be included.};\vspace*{-6pt}
 \item examples of Makefiles which may be used to link the code  with QUESO library;\vspace*{-6pt}
 \item how to plot figures using Matlab/GNU Octave  and the output data generated by each application. 
\end{itemize}

All the examples presented in this chapter may be found under the directory \texttt{examples} in both \Queso{} installation and build directories and are compatible with QUESO \QUESOversion{}.
